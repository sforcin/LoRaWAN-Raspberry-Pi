# LoRaWAN-Raspberry-Pi
I will be using this Repo to describe how I made a LoRaWAN Gateway using a Raspberry Pi 5, a SX1262 LoRa HAT 
This setup was a part of a drone project, where we will mount this gateway to a drone, and fly it to a field, where it will collect LoRa data from sensors. 

This project is a part of the Digital Agriculture Fellowship, sponsored by the United States Department of Agriculture, in partnership with the University of California, Riverside, Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering.
